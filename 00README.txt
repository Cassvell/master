            Mexican Magnetic Index K (K_mex)
            
  <<index DIR>>
                                             
  The index directory contains the calculated values for local K (K_mex) and 
  a (a_mex) indices of geomagnetic activity in Mexico.
  
  The index directory has three subdirectories: day, month and year. Each one of
  them has data files with the values of K_mex and a_mex for different time spams.
  The files in each subdirectory are:
        GMS_YYYYMMDD.final[/early].index  {/day}
        GMS_YYYYMM.final[/early].index    {/month}
        GMS_YYYY.final[/early].index      {/year}
  with GMS the geomagnetic station code, YYYYMMDD the date. The extention 
  early[final] appoints that the analysis is done with data between
  27 days before[and 27 days after] the given date.

  Additionally, each subdirectory has other subdirectories whose names are the
  corresponding GMS name, where the data come from.

  Kmex is a prodcut by the Mexican Space Weather Service (SCiESMEX) at the 
  National Space Weather Laboratory (LANCE) in colaboration with the Geomagnetic
  Service at Geophysic Institute-UNAM.

                     GEOMAGNETIC K and A INDICES

  THREE-HOUR GEOMAGNETIC INDEX K:
  K indix isolates the effects of solar particle on the earth's magnetic field
  over a 3-hour period. Its values classify into disturbance levels the range of
  variation of the more unsettled horizontal (H) field component. Each K level
  relates almost logarithmically to its corresponding disturbance amplitude on H. 
  Three-hour periods help to discriminate between true geomagnetic perturbations
  and the cyclical variations daily produced by non-perturbed ionospheric currents.

  K indices range in 28 steps from 0 (quiet/unperturbed) to 9 (greatly disturbed)
  with fractional parts expressed in rounded thirds of a unit. A K-value equal 
  to 47, for example, means 4 and 2/3 or 5-. A value of K equal to 60 means 6 
  and 0/3 or just K=6; and a K=23 means 2 and 1/3 or 2+.


  EQUIVALENT AMPLITUDE
  The a-index ranges from 0 to 400 and represents a K-value converted to a linear
  scale that measures equivalent disturbance amplitude of a station at which K=9
  has a lower limit of 400 nT.
